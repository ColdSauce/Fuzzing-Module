# Fuzzing-Module

TODO: reword all the poor word choices of alex maleno bc he cannot write

TODO: have classmates read through learning module to get an estimate of how long it would take to complete the module (time differences for different levels of complexity) and write that here

TODO: table of contents with links (maybe, idk if we can do this within markdown, figure it out later)

## Introduction

Within this repository is this ReadMe, which gives an overview about what fuzzing is, why one would want to fuzz, and a detailed guide to teach anyone familiar with Computer Science about how they can start up their own fuzzing project. 

## What Is Fuzzing?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), fuzzing is automated input testing for a codebase or executable. While fuzzing, invalid or unexpected (sometimes random) data is provided to an executable in hopes of finding some undefined behavior, or vulnerability. For more information about what fuzzing is and how it can be beneficial, you can look at [Google's Fuzzing repo](https://github.com/google/fuzzing).

## Terms Used Throughout the Module
TODO: keep adding to this as we write the module so people know what terms mean


## Tools Used

We use a number of tools throughout this learning module (with download links as they come up), so we will define them here.
