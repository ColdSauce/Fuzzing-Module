Many projects that exist are horrible in their own unique way - whether
it is how the build system is organized, how the files are organized
in subdirectories and modules, or even the style of the code written (if 
there even is a consistent style). This is an example of a simple "drone"
project (it doesn't actually do anything), and the way the files are 
built is simple and easy to understand. Looking at the CMakeLists.txt 
should be self explanatory, even if you have no experience reading or 
writing CMake code yourself.
